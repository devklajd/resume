  description: `
  As a Software Engineer, I am the architect weaving intricate codes on platforms like Laravel, WordPress, and React. Yet, my passions extend far beyond the digital realm. I'm just as enthusiastic about cars as I am about crafting elegant algorithms. With a fervor for the open road and the rush of automotive innovation, my love for engines parallels my zeal for coding.
  
  Nature, an endless reservoir of inspiration, holds a special place in my heart. From the calming whispers of towering forests to the vast expanses of serene landscapes, the beauty of the natural world fuels my creativity.
  
  My journey into the labyrinth of technology began in my formative years. Fueled by an insatiable curiosity for computers and the mysterious language of coding, I embarked on a quest that started in childhood. This innate drive has been the guiding force behind my unwavering dedication to my craft.
  
  Whether amidst the complexities of software or navigating the winding roads, I persist with the same vigor and commitment. Embracing the harmony between technology and nature, I am a Software Engineer, steering through lines of code with the same thrill as the open highwayâ€”a fusion of passion for technology and an unyielding love for the natural world.`,

      <p>
        At Tirana Square Center I used to build websites mostly on Wordpress, depending on
what the client was asking for, I used to work in a team of 4 other developers and
designers. We used to design specific icons with Illustrator and upload them as SVG
(keeping the highest quality possible) and implement each icon where it was needed.I
used to get different types of plugins and edit each plugin on what would be the best for
our project's needs.
From customizing templates up to making custom plugins.
-My main skills were : WordPress (ELEMENTOR , WP Bakery),
PHP 8, HTML Structure, CSS, MYSQL DB

      <p>
        At Electral I had to build and maintain different websites from WordPress to other
frameworks such as Laravel. Working alone with no one else was a huge challenge and I
was able to test myself on how much pressure I could handle. Mostly at the time, I was
able to build complex websites in Wordpress very easily and the delivery time of
Wordpress Websites was much faster than Laravel. Working at Electral made Me realize
how much work I could handle alone and being able to work on 2-3 projects at the same
time. Besides working on templates and making the needed changes, I was able to
integrate different API-s on Laravel Projects such as:
â€¢ Facebook Pixel (Marketing Tool)
â€¢ Laravel Routes
â€¢ Laravel Controllers
â€¢ NodeJS
â€¢ ExpressJS
â€¢ Laravel payment getaways with PayPal/Bank Payment Gateways 
â€¢ Front-End on REACT 
â€¢ Stripe API 
â€¢ 2Checkout 
Developed good knowledge and skills when I was introduced to Laravel framework which
I understood how web-apps work.
Continuing at Electral, I expanded my skills from WordPress to Laravel, mastering the
intricacies of web applications. In Laravel, I specialized in full-stack development,
optimizing payment gateways for secure transactions. Simultaneously, I excelled in
ReactJS, crafting dynamic user interfaces. Collaborating with APIs like Stripe and
2Checkout, I ensured end-to-end solutions, showcasing versatility as a developer. My
journey signifies a seamless transition from WordPress to becoming a proficient full-stack
developer in Laravel, ReactJS, NextJS.

      <p>
        Web Developer/Designer | Project Manager & Client Relations Since 4-Ducks Corporation
was located in Las Vegas USA, I had to work remotely from my home. Knowing that
Albanian time is ahead of the USA, my first "task" as I put myself into was to stay awake
all night and get to know project information and talk directly with the client on Zoom
Calls. Each project was different from the other ones. Some of them needed to be worked
on WordPress, other ones on fully custom code on Laravel & other ones on Shopify. I
didn't work on all projects myself but I had the responsibility of them all. Each project had
3-4 other developers and I had to give them each project information and each task to
each one of them. I was responsible for the project deadline and I had to run tests, check
for errors, and the quality of the site before it got delivered on the final process right
before we had to present it to our clients.
Skills used and developed from 4-Ducks Corporation :
â€¢ WordPress (Theme customization,Plugin Customization, ELEMENTOR, WP Bakery,SEO)
â€¢ Shopify (Custom Store Development, Design, Different Payment Gateways)
â€¢ FIGMA
â€¢ Illustrator
â€¢ Full Stack Development
â€¢ Laravel / Laravel Nova
â€¢ ReactJS
â€¢ NodeJS
â€¢ ExpressJS
â€¢ NextJS
â€¢ Azure
â€¢ AWS
â€¢ RESTful API Development
â€¢ Database Design and Management (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
â€¢ Error Handling and Debugging
â€¢ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
â€¢ Authentication and Authorization
â€¢ ReactJS
â€¢ State Management
â€¢ Component-Based Architecture
â€¢ Deployment
